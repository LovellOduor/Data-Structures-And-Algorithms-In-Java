Priority Queue
Priority queue is a data structure that allows us to find minimum/maximum elements
in a collection of elements in constant time.
It supports the following operations.
- Insert(key) - Insert a key into the priority queue.
- deleteMax()/deleteMin() - return and remove the largest/smallest key.
- getMax()/getMin() - return largest/smallest key.

Binary Heap
- A datastructure that helps in implementing the priority queue operations efficiently.
- It is a complete binary tree in which each node value is >= or <= 
  than the values of its children.

Complete binary tree
- A binary tree where all levels are completley filled except last level and last level 
  has nodes in such a way the left side is never empty.
