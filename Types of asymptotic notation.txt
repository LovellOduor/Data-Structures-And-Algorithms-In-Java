Types of Asymptotic Notations
1. Omega Ω Notation
- The formal way of expressing the lower bound of an algorithm's runtime.
- This means, for any input this notation determines the best amount of time an algorithm can take to complete.
2. Big O Notation
- Expresses the upper bound of an algorithms running time.
- Upper bound means for any given input, this notation determines longest amount of time an algorithm can take to complete.
3. Theta Θ Notation
- Expresses both upper bound and lower bound of an algorithm's running time.
- This means the average amount of time an algorithm takes to complete.
