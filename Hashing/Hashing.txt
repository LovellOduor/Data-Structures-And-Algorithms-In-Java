Hash Functions

A Hash Function simply takes an arbitrary size key
and provides fixed size value also called as index. 

Types of Hash Functions

Modular Hash Function
A Modular Hash function simply takes a key and size,
returns remainder by dividing key by size.

The remainder is used as an index to store the key in an array of provided
size.

Simple Modular Hash Function

keys {5,1,10,26,99}

Modular Hash Function 

index = h(key) = key % size
size = 10

Terms

- Keys are inputs that you want to be hashed.
- Index is the output of a hash function.
- Size is the size of the array that will map the index
  (Hash output) to the original value stored in the array.

  For example the Modular Hashed output of the
  array keys above will be

  [10,1,_,_,_,5,26,_,_,99]

  Collision

  This is a situation whereby multiple keys are 
  mapped to the same index. For example

  10 % 10 = 0 
  100 % 10 = 0

  This can be fixed with some techniques to be 
  discussed later.

  Hash Table

  - It is a generalized form of an Array.
  - It stored data in key-value pair.
  - It converts key to an Index using hash function.
  - Taking the index we store key-value in an array.
  - The primary operations supported are:-
    put(key,value) - Adds key-value pair against unique key.
    get(key) - Get value for the provided key.
    remove(key) - Removes the Key-value pair from the Hash Table.
  - Average runtime is of O(1).
  - Java collections class has HashMap if we want to deal with key-value 
    pairs and HashSet if we want to deal with only keys.
